# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game

I have made a simple Tic Tac Toe Game , in which two players can play the game at a same time.

I have considered all the winning possibilities and at the end of the game a small stats appears regarding the number of games played , number of games won by players and the number of game than has been draw between the players.
